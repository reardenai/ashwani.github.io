<ol>
<li>As soon as you starts feeling worry/Anxiety remind yourself that there are some unprocessed thoughts , and make it conscious .</li>
<li>Once you know that something is bothering you , try to define in as much detail as possible , include every (detail/possibility).</li>
<li>Put those details into three buckets :<ul>
<li>In my control</li>
<li>With effort can be in my control </li>
<li>can-never be in my control</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Act on first and second bucket and ignore the last bucket .</li>
</ol>
<p>after acting on these 4 steps for some time , either of 2 things will happen</p>
<ol>
<li>your assumption were correct , you actually solved the problem .[ MATTER CLOSED ] [ FINISHED COMPUTATION ] [ YOU WILL FEEL STRONG ]</li>
<li>your assumption were incorrect , you sidestepped actual problem.[ MATTER STILL OPEN ] [ VISIT STEPS AGAIN ] [ YOU WILL FEEL BETTER ]</li>
</ol>
